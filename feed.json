            "content_html": "\n  <p>\n    I know, you want to self host, for instance, your own webpage, but every time you search for info, people only recommend you to use sh*t like NO-IP and third party providers such as Heroku. But that's not what you want, right? You have a Rashberry Pi or somo old PC and you intent to host your own services, like your webpage, a torrent server or even some filebrowser to manage storage.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Ok, then I will save you a lot of hours or researching how to mount everything, how to deal with nginx, how to get https certificates... and I will show you the best way of setting up everything.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"prepare-your-server-machine\">\n      Prepare your server machine\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Firtsly, I will start by getting an ISO of Ubuntu Server (you can use another ISOs, like arch linux or Nix, if you are brave enough).&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04.1/ubuntu-22.04.1-live-server-amd64.iso\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04.1/ubuntu-22.04.1-live-server-amd64.iso</a>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Then, use some program, like <a href=\"https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/releases/download/v3.17/rufus-3.17.exe\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Rufus</a> or <a href=\"https://www.balena.io/etcher/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Balena Etcher</a> to flash that ISO into an USB or SD Card (in case you're using a Rashberry Pi).\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    If you are not familiar with this, take a look into <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wt0Q-DBejIw\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">this tutorial</a>.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Ok, now we have an USB or SD Card flashed with our favourite OS for our server. Now it is time to insert that into the server we will be using. If it's possible I recommend you to connect that device to a monitor, in order to see what is happening and make some SSH configurations.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Once the operating system is installed, we will create a new user and get rid of the default user. (Using the root user for everything is a bad idea).\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>sudo adduser Username\nsudo usermod -aG sudo Username\n</code></pre>\n\n    <h2 id=\"how-to-connect-to-our-machine\">\n      How to connect to our machine\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Next, we will configure SSH to be able to connect to our device from another pc. This way it is easier to manage the server (and we will be able to disconnect the monitor from the server).\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    I have another guide about how configure SSH to be secure and ready to use, go ahead a <a href=\"https://baronhez.github.io/how-to-configure-ssh-to-be-secure/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"\">check it</a>.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"unattended-upgrades-optional\">\n      Unattended upgrades (optional)\n    </h2>\n\n  <p class=\"msg msg--highlight\">\n    If you don't want automated updates, skip this section.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Ok, now that we are able to connect to the server using SSH, and SSH is configure to be secure, it is time to install our first packages.\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>sudo apt install unattended-upgrades\ndpkg-reconfigure --priority=low unattended-upgrades\n# Now, select yes to enable unattended-upgrades.\n# Once you finish with that, you can change some lines in the configuration of unattended-upgrades.\nnano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic\n</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    For instance, you can configure something like this:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists \"1\";\nAPT::Periodic::Download-Upgradeable-Packages \"1\";\nAPT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval \"7\";\nAPT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade \"1\";</code></pre>\n\n    <h2 id=\"email-your-logs-to-yourself-optional\">\n      Email your logs to yourself (optional)\n    </h2>\n\n  <p class=\"msg msg--highlight\">\n    If you don't want to email your logs, skip this section.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    If you want to keep track of your logs and email them to you, then you can use <a href=\"https://linux.die.net/man/8/logwatch\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Logwatch</a>.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    To install and configure logwatch, run these commands:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>sudo apt-get install logwatch\nnano /etc/cron.daily/00logwatch</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    Then, add this line:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-html\"><code>/usr/sbin/logwatch --output mail --mailto yourmail@gmail.com --detail high  </code></pre>\n\n    <h2 id=\"installation-of-docker-and-dockercompose\">\n      Installation of Docker and Docker-Compose\n    </h2>\n\n  <p class=\"msg msg--info\">\n    The rest of the guide focuses on using docker and docker-compose to deploy services. If you want to deploy your services manually by configuring nginx and cert-manager, go ahead and try it yourself. If you want to do it using kubernetes, I will publish a guide as soon as possible.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    It's time to install docker and docker compose:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade\nsudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common  \ncurl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -\nsudo add-apt-repository \"deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable\"  \napt-cache policy docker-ce\nsudo apt install docker-ce\nsudo systemctl status docker\nsudo curl -L \"https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.26.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)\" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose  \nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose\n</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    Now,&nbsp;assuming that everything went well, we should have docker and docker-compose installed in our server.&nbsp; It's time to test docker-compose by deploying a small web in our local network.\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>mkdir app\nnano app/index.html\n</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    Insert this content into the <b>index.html</b> file:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-html\"><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Docker Compose Demo&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kognise/water.css@latest/dist/dark.min.css\"&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n\n\t&lt;h1&gt;This is a Docker Compose Demo Page.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\t&lt;p&gt;This content is being served by an Nginx container.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    Save the file, and run the following command:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>nano docker-compose.yml</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    Insert this content into the <b>docker-compose.yml</b> file:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-yaml\"><code>version: '3.7'\nservices:\n  web:\n    image: nginx:alpine\n    ports:\n      - \"8000:80\"\n    volumes:\n      - ./app:/usr/share/nginx/html</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    Now, to start our aplication&nbsp;containerized, we must run the following command:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>docker-compose up -d\n</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    That command should return an output like this one:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-html\"><code>Creating network \"compose-demo_default\" with the default driver\nPulling web (nginx:alpine)...\nalpine: Pulling from library/nginx\ncbdbe7a5bc2a: Pull complete\n10c113fb0c77: Pull complete\n9ba64393807b: Pull complete\nc829a9c40ab2: Pull complete\n61d685417b2f: Pull complete\nDigest: sha256:57254039c6313fe8c53f1acbf15657ec9616a813397b74b063e32443427c5502\nStatus: Downloaded newer image for nginx:alpine\nCreating compose-demo_web_1 ... done</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    Now, your webpage should be accesible through your browser by typing \"local-IP-of-your-server:8000\".\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Ok, now that we have a webpage deployed in our local network, I should share a few useful commands to manage Docker:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code># We can see the logs of our containers\ndocker-compose logs\n# Pause our containers\ndocker-compose pause\n# Unpause our containers\ndocker-compose unpause\n# Stop our containers\ndocker-compose stop\n# Delete all the resources and volumes assigned to our containers\ndocker-compose down\n# List our images\ndocker images\n# Delete our images\ndocker image rm nginx:alpine\n# Or\ndocker rmi nginx:alpine\n# We can delete all stoped container, every network not use by al least one container, every unused image and all build cache.\ndocker system prune -a\n# Do the same but filtering specific images\ndocker system prune --filter nginx:alpine\n# Or just the volumes\ndocker system prune --volumes\n# Or we can do the same but without asking for confirmation\ndocker system prune -a -f  \n</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    Now, if you want to deploy you web to the world outside your local network, you must change a few things in your router (supposing you have access to the router). It is completely necessary to set port-forwarding, because if you are mounting your server at home, your devices are connected inside your home using a private network. It is possible for us to connect to the internet thanks to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">NAT</a>.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Each router is a different world, so you must search information about how to port-forward in your home router.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    On the other hand, if you're using some provider for your server, such as a VM in Oracle Cloud, then it should be easier. Search for your specific provider how to port-forward and that's the end of the problem.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"using-a-domain-name-and-ddns\">\n      Using a domain name and DDNS\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Ok, if you want to access your webpage easily without having to memorize a bunch of numbers, you have to buy a domain name. I recommend&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.namecheap.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" data-link-popup-id=\"1661636146747\">https://www.namecheap.com/</a>. It provides cheap domain names and it is also a DNS provider, but you can pick whichever you want.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    If you want to point your domain name to your server, there is one problem if your server is in your home. Most ISPs (or all of them, to be honest) nowadays change your public IP from time to time. If you don't want to lose access to your webpage when that happens, we must use Dynamic DNS. It is necessary to set DDNS with your DNS provider and use a DDNS client in our server to comunicate with our DNS provider. The DDNS client will inform the DNS provider of your new IP.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    I use <a href=\"https://ddclient.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ddclient</a> for that, because Namecheap has a <a href=\"https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/583/11/how-do-i-configure-ddclient/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">guide</a> to use it with them.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"using-https-certificates-from-lets-encrypt\">\n      Using HTTPS certificates from Let's Encrypt\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Next step is to create HTTPS certificates for our webpage. The docker way of doing this is by configurating let's encrypt. We can do it using different methods, but the best for me is using one of the best&nbsp;Edge Router nowadays. I'm talking of <a href=\"https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><u>Traefik</u></a>.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    I will save you tons of documentation, because this guide is already too long. If you want to set a reverse proxy with traefik which also can generate certificates with Let's Encrypt, just use this files:\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    First, create an acme.json file and change its privilegies (take into account the path of the acme.json file, because you have to add that path to the <b>docker-compose.yaml</b> file:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>touch acme.json\nchmod 600 acme.json</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    Now, create a folder and two different files for traefik configuration (put your domain name where it says YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME and your preferred email where it says youremail@example.com):\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>mkdir ./config\nnano ./config/traefik.yml</code></pre>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-yaml\"><code># traefik.yml\napi:\n  dashboard: true # Enable the dashboard\nentryPoints:\n  web:\n    address: \":80\"\n    http:\n      redirections:\n        entryPoint:\n          to: web-secure\n  web-secure:\n    address: \":443\"\n    http:\n      tls:\n        certResolver: default\nproviders:\n        # In order to get this working on docker, refer to https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/docker/ for more info.\n  docker:\n    endpoint: \"unix:///var/run/docker.sock\"\n    exposedByDefault: false # As seen in the documentation, \"Expose containers by default through Traefik.

You can add more middlewares, such as rate limit or plugins like fail2ban. I'm not covering that here right now.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Lastly, a <b>docker-compose.yaml</b>(put your domain name where it says YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME and put the path to your acme.json file and your webpage folder):\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>nano docker-compose.yaml</code></pre>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-yaml\"><code>version: '3.7'\nservices:\n  traefik:\n    image: traefik:2.5.5\n    container_name: traefik\n    network_mode: host\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    volumes:\n      - ./config/:/etc/traefik/\n      - /path/to/acme.json:/etc/traefik/acme/acme.json\n      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock\n  web:\n    image: nginx:1.21.4-alpine\n    container_name: web\n    restart: always\n    expose:\n      - \"80\"\n    volumes:\n      - /path/to/your/webpage/folder:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro\n    labels:\n      - traefik.enable=true\n      - traefik.http.routers.webpage.entryPoints=web-secure\n      - traefik.http.routers.webpage.rule=Host(`YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME`)\n      - \"traefik.http.routers.webpage.middlewares=secHeader@file\"\n</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    If you want to deploy more services, just add this to every new service in a docker-compose file:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-yaml\"><code> labels:\n      - traefik.enable=true\n      - traefik.http.routers.NAME-ROUTER.entryPoints=web-secure\n      - traefik.http.routers.NAME-ROUTER.rule=Host(`YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME`)\n      - \"traefik.http.routers.NAME-ROUTER.middlewares=secHeader@file\"</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    Just remember to change NAME-ROUTER to another name each time (it is the name of the <a href=\"https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/routing/routers/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" class=\"\" target=\"_blank\">traefik router</a>) and YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME should be a subdomain, such as <b>nextcloud.example.com</b>&nbsp;for a hipothetical nextcloud service.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    To deploy this configuration, go to the folder where the <b>docker-compose.yaml</b> file is, and run the following command:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>sudo docker-compose up -d</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    If you go to your domain, assuming that you previouly pointed the domain to your server IP (or the public IP of your router, in case of a home server), the webpage should be displayed in the browser as intended.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    That's it, you have started in the selfhosting hobby.

Oh, don't you have SSH in your server yet? Ok, then, run these commands in your server:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>sudo apt-get install openssh-server\nsudo systemctl enable ssh\nsudo systemctl start ssh</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    Apt-get doesn't work? Ok, you're not using a debian based distro in your server, so you have to search how to install packages in your distro (it is a 1 minuto google search, I promise).\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Ok, now that SSH is working in our server, connect to the server from another computer, just for testing. If it is working, now run this command in your server (is going to create the directory for the keys and change the permissions of that directory):\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>mkdir ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    Now, we have to generate the keys in our computer.\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code># For Windows:\nssh-keygen -b 4096\n# The keys are stored in \"%userprofile%\\.ssh\" as id_rsa and id_rsa.pub by default.\n#Now, transfer the public key to the server.\nscp $env:USERPROFILE/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Username@123.445.566.233:~/.ssh/authorized_keys    \n# Replace the Username and IP with your own Username and Server IP.\n# For Linux:\nssh-keygen -b 4096\n# The keys are stored in \"~/.ssh\" as id_rsa and id_rsa.pub by default.\n# Now, transfer the public key to the server.\nssh-copy-id Username@123.445.566.233\n# Replace the Username and IP with your own Username and Server IP.\n# For Mac:\nssh-keygen -b 4096\n# The keys are stored in \"~/.ssh\" as id_rsa and id_rsa.pub by default.\n# Now, transfer the public key to the server.\nscp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Username@123.445.566.233:~/.ssh/authorized_keys    \n# Replace the Username and IP with your own Username and Server IP.\n</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    Ok, if you connect now to your server through SSH, you will connect directly, without having to input a password. Now, let's continue with the next step.\n  </p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"disable-password-login\">\n      Disable password login\n    </h3>\n\n  <p>\n    Edit the file&nbsp;<i>/etc/ssh/sshd_config </i>using some editor like Nano or Vim. First, search for the <b>KbdInteractiveAuthentication</b> line and change the value to no. This way is not possible to use a keyboard during&nbsp;authentication. Next thing we have to change is&nbsp; <b>PasswordAuthentication</b>. Again, the default value is yes, but we’ll be setting it to no.\n  </p>\n\n  <p class=\"msg msg--info\">\n    Some people may say something like \"Change the ssh port to another one\", but a real hacker (most likely a bot) will scan your ports searching for it, so this act is stupid and annoying without any good reason.\n  </p>\n\n  <p class=\"msg msg--info\">\n    You can also disable root login, but since your user will surely have sudo privileges... well, I leave up to you to decide if it is worth it (I have my root login disable).\n  </p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"remove-weak-prime-numbers\">\n      Remove weak prime numbers\n    </h3>\n\n  <p>\n    The client and the server use these moduli to negotiate a secure key. Remove the small ones by runnings these commands:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>cp /etc/ssh/moduli ~/copy_moduli \nawk '$5 &gt;= 3071' /etc/ssh/moduli &gt; /etc/ssh/moduli.safe\nmv /etc/ssh/moduli.safe /etc/ssh/moduli    </code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    The first command makes a security copy before changing the moduli in the home folder of your user. The second command looks for lines in /etc/ssh/moduli, which on the fifth line have a value bigger than 3071 and writes those in the moduli.safe file. Then, the third command replace the moduli using the moduli.safe file.\n  </p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"allow-strong-cyphers-only\">\n      Allow strong cyphers only\n    </h3>\n\n  <p>\n    We are going to allow only the most secure cyphers.

This key is generated on a per user basis, and as a result is not system-wide.&nbsp;To do this simply run:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>google-authenticator</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    Upon running the command, you’ll be asked a few questions. The first one asks if authentication tokens should be time-based. We want to select <b>y</b>:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>Do you want authentication tokens to be time-based (y/n): y</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    Once we select yes, the app will generate a QR code that can be scanned within your authenticator app of choice.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    This PAM allows for time-based or sequential-based tokens. Using sequential-based tokens mean the code starts at a certain point and then increments the code after every use. Using time-based tokens mean the code changes randomly after a certain time elapses (usually 60s). We’ll stick with time-based because that is what apps like Google Authenticator anticipate.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The remaining questions inform the PAM how to function. We’ll go through them one by one.\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>Do you want me to update your \"/home/zephr/.google_authenticator\" file? (y/n)  </code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    This writes the key and options to the <b>~/.google_authenticator</b> file. If you select no, then the program will quit and nothing is saved which in turn results in the authenticator application not working. Therefore we want to select <b>yes </b>for this!&nbsp;\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-html\"><code>By default, tokens are good for 30 seconds and in order to compensate for\npossible time-skew between the client and the server, we allow an extra\ntoken before and after the current time. If you experience problems with poor\ntime synchronization, you can increase the window from its default\nsize of 1:30min to about 4min. Do you want to do so (y/n) n</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    Selecting yes for this question enables up to 8 valid codes in a moving four minute window. By answering no, you limit it to 3 valid codes in a 90 second rolling window.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Unless you find issues with the 90 second window, answering no is the more secure choice.\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-html\"><code>If the computer that you are logging into isn't hardened against brute-force\nlogin attempts, you can enable rate-limiting for the authentication module.\nBy default, this limits attackers to no more than 3 login attempts every 30s.\nDo you want to enable rate-limiting (y/n) y</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    Rate limiting means a remote attacker can only attempt a certain number of guesses before being blocked. I recommend you to answer <b>yes</b>.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Once you finish this setup, if you want to back up your secret key, you can copy the <b>~/.google-authenticator</b> file to a trusted location.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Once we've been through the steps to configure google authenticator, the next step is to setup our SSH config to allow authenticator to function:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>sudo nano /etc/pam.d/sshd</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    Add the following line to the bottom of the file:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code># Standard Un*x password updating.\n@include common-password\nauth required pam_google_authenticator.so nullok  </code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    The <b>nullok</b> word at the end of the last line tells the PAM that this authentication method is optional. This allows users without a OATH-TOTP token to still log in using their SSH key. If you remove <b>nullok</b>&nbsp;from the line, this MFA would be mandatory.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Next, we’ll configure SSH to support this kind of authentication. Open the SSH configuration file for editing.\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    &nbsp;We are going to make SSH aware of MFA by adding AuthenticationMethods and UsePAM:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code># To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here!\nPasswordAuthentication no\n#PermitEmptyPasswords no\n\n# Change to yes to enable challenge-response passwords (beware issues with\n# some PAM modules and threads)\n\n\n#ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes\nKbdInteractiveAuthentication yes\nUsePAM yes\nAuthenticationMethods publickey,password publickey,keyboard-interactive</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    Save the config and restart the SSH service.\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>sudo systemctl reload sshd.service</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    Now, you have MFA for your SSH.\n  </p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"enable-firewall-and-make-use-ofnbspratelimiting\">\n      Enable Firewall and make use of&nbsp;Rate-Limiting\n    </h3>\n\n  <p>\n    First, install Uncomplicated Firewall(UFW).\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>sudo apt install ufw\n</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    Now, set a rate limit:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>## ufw limit ssh various usage ##\nufw limit ssh comment 'Rate limit for openssh server'</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    When a limit rule is used, ufw will normally allow the connection but will deny connections if an IP address attempts to initiate six or more connections within thirty seconds.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    You can also allow or disallow connections from specific IPs:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>   sudo ufw allow from 1.2.3.4 to any port 22</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    The above example only allows connections from 1.2.3.4 to port 22.\n  </p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"set-up-fail2ban\">\n      Set up Fail2Ban\n    </h3>\n\n  <p>\n    We can go a little further by setting up Fail2Ban.&nbsp;Fail2Ban essentially actively looks out for signs of potential password authentication abuses to filter out IP addresses and regularly update the system firewall to suspend these IP addresses for a certain period.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    To install and setup Fail2Ban, run the following commands:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>sudo apt install fail2ban\nsudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.{conf,local}\nsudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    To configure Fail2Ban, modify the following lines:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>bantime = 1d</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    If you assign a negative value, the ban will be permanent.\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>findtime = 10m</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    <b>findtime</b>&nbsp;defines&nbsp;the time-duration allowed between consecutive login attempts.

If the number of failed-authorization attempts within the findtime exceeds the maxretry value, the IP would be banned from logging back in.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Fail2ban also allows you to grant immunity to IP addresses and IP ranges of your choice.\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8 ::1 222.222.222.222 192.168.55.0/24</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    Upon setting all the options you want, simply start the service then check the status:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>sudo systemctl start fail2ban\nsudo systemctl status fail2ban</code></pre>\n\n    <h2 id=\"credits\">\n      Credits\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    I found all this tweaks and tricks in random sources from internet, but to sum it all, all of them can be found in two webpages, so the credit goes to the authors of <a href=\"https://disknotifier.com/blog/simple-ssh-security/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"\">https://disknotifier.com/blog/simple-ssh-security/</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.zsec.uk/locking-down-ssh-the-right-way/\" target=\"_blank\">https://blog.zsec.uk/locking-down-ssh-the-right-way</a>/.\n  </p>",
